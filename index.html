       <b>ADOLF HITLER</b> was a German political leader who rose to power as Chancellor of Germany in 1933 and later became the dictator of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945. He was born on April 20, 1889, in Austria and died by suicide on April 30, 1945, in Berlin, Germany. </p>    </center>

   <center>    <p1 style="font-size: 30px;">Adolf Hitler is infamous for his role in instigating World War II and for his leadership of the National Socialist German Workers' Party, commonly known as the Nazi Party. During his time in power, he implemented a regime characterized by extreme authoritarianism, racism, anti-Semitism, and a desire for territorial expansion. His policies and actions led to the genocide of approximately six million Jews during the Holocaust, as well as the deaths of millions of others in the war.</p1>    </center>

    <center>   <p2 style="font-size: 30px">Hitler's leadership of Nazi Germany ended with the defeat of the Axis Powers in 1945, and his death marked the conclusion of World War II in Europe. He remains a highly controversial and reviled figure in history due to the atrocities committed under his leadership during this period.</p2>    </center>
